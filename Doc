Create a Symfony 3 project with PhpStorm
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Go to File -> Settings -> Plugins (or PhpStorm -> Preferences -> Plugins if you're on a mac)
2.Install Symfony2 Plugin, Twig Support and YAML through the "Browse repositories..." menu
3.If you use the PhpStorm 9 EAP version you also need the "Framework MVC Structure Support" plugin from the "Install JetBrains plugin" menu
4.Restart PhpStorm
5.Go to File -> Settings -> Symfony2 Plugin
6.Check Enable Plugin for this Project
7.Now go to Directories under Project Settings and exclude app/cache and app/logs. This helps with performance problems in PhpStorm
8.Still in the settings page, go to PHP -> Framework Integration
9.Check Enable framework integration and change Autodetect to Symfony2
10.Browse to web in the file tree and set Element to web root directory
11.Set the element for vendor to vendor
12.Set app to application configuration directory
13.Set src to project code directory
14.Restart PhpStorm (Its starting to look like firefox)
15.Click on View -> Tool Windows -> Framework

Integrating the Symfony Console
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is also possible to integrate the symfony console with PhpStorm (<project root>/app/console). This enables help and completion for the symfony commands (build in and your own) and saves you from typing php app/console do:something every time.

1. Go to your project settings/preferences -> Tools -> Command Line Tool Support
2. Click the green plus button and set the "Choose tool" menu to "Symfony" and make sure the visibility is set to "project" (since the app/console script is specific for one symfony installation)
3. Then for "Path to Symfony" choose <project root>/bin/console in the filebrowser
4. Make sure a valid PHP executable is chosen in the "Path to PHP executable" field.
5. Press ok a few times to save everything. Now you have console integration.

To use this integration go in the main menubar to Tools -> Run Command..., A new tool window should appear. The alias for php app/console is now s so you can type s doctrine:create:database for example to run a command.
